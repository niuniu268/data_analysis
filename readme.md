looking through the data set

the number of contacts is decimal and has six digits after the decimal 
so that the unit of contacts is per million.
Two problems have been found:
1. It is abnormal that the value of visits is negative
2. It is weird that the number of visits is positive, whilst the number of contacts is equal to zero. 
In other words, people did not see the spots when they visit Trivago website.
To attempt to reveal reasons which cause this problem
